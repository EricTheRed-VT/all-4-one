GUIDE TO ADDING FEATURES INTO STATE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:

FRONT END:
1. Import socket into your feature and use it to emit your data:
socket.emit('throw bomb', bombdata)

-Emit on discrete player actions, not in the update loop

BACK END:

2. Add the .on to the listeners.js file on the backend and dispatch your data to the store
3. Add a reducer (Make a new file in the reducers folder if appropriate)

-The backend periodically emits it's state, so you don't need to do anything else

FRONT END II:
4. Add a listener for the data in listeners.js and a reducer in the reducers folder. This should be nearly identical to what you did on the backend. 
5. Add game logic to handle the new data in the state, the logic should ultimently be called from the update loop
